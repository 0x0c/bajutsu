"""The `Repository` seam: the hosted backend's system of record (BE-0015 7a).

Shaped like the other server seams (`object_store.py`): a `Protocol`, a SQLAlchemy implementation,
and an env-driven factory — with SQLAlchemy and the ORM models lazy-imported inside the functions
that need them, so the default `serve`/CLI path never loads them (the import guard locks this).
7a ships the `runs` methods (`RunRecord`); the orgs, users, jobs, and secrets methods extend the
same seam with their own boundary types. ORM rows never leak past the seam — only the boundary
types cross."""
