class LocalTreeScenarioStorage:
    """`ScenarioStorage` that reads from the bound config's already-extracted local-tree dir
    (BE-0324), instead of the object-storage bucket `ObjectScenarioStorage` reads.

    A Git checkout, an uploaded zip, and a composed-artifact bind (BE-0063/BE-0073/BE-0268) all
    extract their scenario tree onto the control plane's own disk before serving a single request —
    the same tree `_scenarios_dir_for` (`bajutsu.serve.state`) already resolves for the local
    backend. `list` and `read` reuse `LocalScenarioStore` (`bajutsu.serve.scenarios`) — the same
    resolver the local backend wires onto `ServeState` — rather than re-deriving dir resolution and
    reconstructing its scope, so the BE-0051 path-containment guard stays in the one place that
    already implements and tests it. `has_app` delegates to `save_storage`, which already answers it
    from the same *apps* lookup. `save` has no local-tree counterpart yet (a follow-up question, see
    BE-0324's Alternatives), so it delegates to an injected write-side `ScenarioStorage` — the sole
    reason this class holds one (in practice an `ObjectScenarioStorage`, but nothing here depends on
    more than the `ScenarioStorage` protocol it satisfies)."""
