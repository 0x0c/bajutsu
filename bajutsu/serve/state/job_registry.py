        or on a lease reclaim that no worker ever reports — and nothing writes that back to the
        control plane's `Job` (BE-0015 W2), so its slot would be held until serve restarts.

        Run by the counting entry points themselves rather than asked of their callers, the way
        `_freeze_binding` sits inside `register`/`try_register`: a count a caller had to remember to
        precede with a sweep is a count a later caller answers stale — this bug rediscovered.

        The probe runs outside the lock: it is a database read, and holding the registry lock across
        it would block every dispatch on the database. A job registered mid-sweep is simply not
        probed this round and stays counted, which errs toward the cap rather than past it.
