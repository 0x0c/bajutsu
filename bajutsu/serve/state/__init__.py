"""Serve state container: the `ServeState` shared by the serve package and the value types it holds.

Split from `serve/jobs.py` (BE-0206): most of the serve package reads `ServeState` (and the `Job`,
`StoreBundle`, `CaptureSession` value types), while only the run/cancel execution engine — which
stays in `jobs.py` — mutates a `Job`. The runtime dependency is one-directional: `state` imports
`executor` at runtime (for the `LocalExecutor` field default), while `executor` references
`ServeState`/`Job` only under `TYPE_CHECKING` and imports `run_job` lazily — avoiding a
`state ⇄ executor` cycle. The state module keeps the file from growing on two axes at once.
