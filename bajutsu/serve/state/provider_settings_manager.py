    """The per-org AI-provider-settings cluster carved out of `ServeState` (BE-0248): the in-memory
    selection map, its durable store, the two locks that guard them, and the read/write methods —
    the in-memory half of the per-org provider selection (BE-0229). Giving it a boundary makes the
    copy-on-read/copy-on-write discipline a property of this type rather than a convention spread
    across three method bodies, the way `JobRegistry` (BE-0198) made atomic id assignment a property
    of its boundary.

    `settings` maps an org to its `OrgProviderSettings`; `store` is the `default` org's durable
    backing on local serve (None on a hosted deployment, whose per-org stores come from `org_stores`,
    and on a server backend without a database — the selection is then session-only). `_provider_lock`
    guards the in-memory map against concurrent Settings-panel reads/writes (serve is a
    ThreadingHTTPServer); `_persist_lock` serializes the re-snapshot + disk write in `persist`, kept
    separate so I/O never runs inside the in-memory lock.
