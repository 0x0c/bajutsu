"""Operational logging for the hosted serve (BE-0055).

The tool's *own* diagnostic trace — structured (JSON), correlated by ids, and redacted —
deliberately distinct from evidence, the run output stream, and the audit log. It is a
**serve-mode** concern: `configure` is called once at serve startup; the deterministic
`run` / CI gate never imports this module, so that path stays stdlib-only and quiet.

`configure` takes over the root logger as the process's sole sink, so redaction and correlation
cover every record that reaches it (including third-party loggers that propagate to root) without
each call site having to cooperate. A child logger that installs its own non-propagating handler
is its own sink and outside this guarantee.

- **redaction**: known secret *values* are masked on the fully rendered line (`_mask_values`,
  reusing the shared `Redactor` from `redaction.py`), so a secret is scrubbed wherever it lands —
  even inside a non-string field. Sensitive field *names* (`_NameMaskFilter`) are masked
  structurally before serialization. A process-lifetime redactor (serve token, OAuth secret, API
  key) is seeded at `configure`; a run-scoped one (a run's resolved `${secrets.X}`) can be bound
  per run via a `contextvar` wherever those values are in-process.
- **correlation** (`_ContextFilter`): `request_id` / `org` / `actor` / `job_id` / `run_id`
  held in `contextvars` and injected into every record. Cross-process correlation is by shared
  id *value* (the ids already travel in the job spec / are the run's own id), never by
  propagating a context object.
