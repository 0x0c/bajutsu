"""Resident UI Automator server channel (BE-0245): reach the on-device server over adb forward + HTTP.

The resident server (BajutsuAndroidUIAutomatorServer, PR-B) keeps one `UiAutomation` session warm and
answers `GET /source` with `UiDevice.dumpWindowHierarchy` XML, skipping the ≈ 2.4 s per-invocation
`uiautomator dump` startup. This module is the Python end of that channel: it starts the server for a
device lease, forwards a host port to it, fetches the hierarchy, and narrows the whole-screen dump to
the active window so `parse_hierarchy` produces the same Elements the dump path does. Everything above
`AdbDriver._describe()` — the transient-empty retry, `_settle`, selectors — is unchanged; only the
transport differs. A startup or channel failure raises `AdbResidentError`, which the driver catches to
fall back to `uiautomator dump` rather than reading a failed channel as an empty screen.
