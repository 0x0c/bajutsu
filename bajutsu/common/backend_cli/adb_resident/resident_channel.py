    `fetch` returns the current hierarchy and its read mark, blocking until the read postdates the mark
    it is passed (BE-0332 Unit 4); `clock` returns the device's current clock so the driver can anchor
    its read-lag barrier before a gesture; `act` performs a gesture on the device against an element the
    host already resolved, so no coordinate crosses. All three close over the lease's forwarded host
    port.
