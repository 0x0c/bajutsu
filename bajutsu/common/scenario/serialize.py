    The executed scenario is snapshotted into the run's artifacts; a literal base32 seed there is
    durable credential material, so it is replaced with a placeholder before the snapshot is
    written. A `${secrets.*}` reference is left intact (its resolved value never reaches the
    snapshot — BE-0032). Round-trips through the model so the result stays a valid scenario.

    `exclude_defaults` is what keeps that round-trip total: a field validator may reject a value the
    author can never write but a dump still emits — a `default_factory`'s own empty list, which
    `exclude_none` does not drop — so re-validating a model's own dump would fail on a field nobody
    declared (BE-0401 met this on the since-removed `systemAlertHandling.labels`). Excluding
    default-valued fields hands `model_validate` only what was declared, and re-validation restores
    each default, so the returned model is field-for-field the input.

    Drops default-valued fields for the same reason `redact_totp_secrets` does: a model dump that
    emits every default is not reloadable, because a validator reading `model_fields_set` cannot tell
    a default the dump added from a value the author wrote. `VisualMatch._engine_fields` is the
    case — it rejects `colorTolerance` / `antialiasing` alongside `compare: exact`, and both carry
    non-None defaults that `exclude_none` keeps — so the `scenario.yaml` written beside a run's
    results failed to reload, against `dump_scenarios`' own round-trip contract. Excluding them also
    keeps the snapshot as terse as the author wrote it, which is what `dump_block` already does.

    Nothing here touches a value once `model_dump` has produced it: a step's own fieldless action
    (`back: {}`) must survive verbatim or reloading fails the one-of-N-required invariant (§6.2 /
    §6.4), and a free-form `dict[str, Any]` field (`push.payload`) is author data pydantic's own
    `exclude_none`/`exclude_defaults` never look inside — a generic post-pass dropping `None` /
    `[]` there would silently change what a re-run sends, which used to be this function's bug.
