    Unlike `mockServer` (which stubs the dependencies the app *calls*), this hosts the app *under
    test* itself — e.g. the static page for `demos/web`, or the inner `serve` the WebUI dogfood
    drives. `run` probes `readyUrl` first: if it already answers it reuses it (started externally),
    else it runs `cmd`, waits on the readiness probe (a condition wait, never a fixed sleep), and
    tears the process down afterwards.
