# fires it goes inert and the step falls back to its ordinary outcome. In the spirit of BE-0269's

# step failure/timeout rather than an infinite loop.

class _InterruptGuard:
    """Checks a scenario's `interrupts` handlers against already-fetched trees mid-step (BE-0314).

    Analogous to `waits._AlertGuardGate`, but for in-tree interstitial screens the assertion DSL can
    see (not out-of-process system alerts): each entry's `condition` is evaluated against a tree the
    loop already holds — a `wait`'s poll tick, or an act step's pre-action read — and its `steps` run
    to clear the screen when it matches, wherever in the sequence it surfaced. It is the deterministic
    trigger only; `condition` is a machine predicate, never a model call (prime directive 1).

    One guard is built per step, so `_fires` — the per-entry consecutive-fire counter — resets each
    step; an entry that keeps matching (its recovery didn't clear it) goes inert at
    `_INTERRUPT_MAX_FIRES` and the step falls through to its ordinary outcome. A non-matching entry
    resets its own counter, so "consecutive" stays honest. `failure` records a recovery step's
    failure so the caller fails the step loudly rather than swallowing it (determinism first).
