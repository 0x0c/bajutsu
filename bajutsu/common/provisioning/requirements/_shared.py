# Backend actuator (bajutsu.common.backends actuator names) -> what it needs. `xcuitest` (iOS, BE-0290 —
# the sole iOS backend) needs Xcode's `xcodebuild`. The web browser is engine-specific, so it is not
# listed here (see `playwright_browser`). `adb` (Android, BE-0007) needs the platform-tools `adb`
# binary; the emulator is only needed to *boot* an AVD, not to drive a running device, so it is not
# listed. `fake` needs nothing.
