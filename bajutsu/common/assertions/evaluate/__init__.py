"""Assertion dispatch and the small per-kind evaluators.

Evaluate a list of expect/assert against query() results (list[Element]). The list is AND-ed; one
failure fails the step. No AI is involved (machine checks only). Evaluation is total (returns
results instead of raising) so it can be placed straight into the report (manifest). The heavier
per-kind subsystems live in sibling modules: network matching in `network`, image preprocessing in
`visual`, JSON-Schema I/O in `schema`.
