# The driver primitives a record may name. `str` rather than a Literal on purpose: the report
# reconstructs these records from a manifest an older or newer version of the tool wrote (BE-0068
# makes that compatibility the loader's contract), so a Literal would assert at the type level a
# guarantee the file on disk cannot make. A reader treats an unlisted value as opaque text.

    "handle",  # XCUITest actuated a snapshot handle; it chose the point

    "bridge",  # a WebView bridge call addressed by element id, which picks its own coordinate
    "focused",  # a text primitive on whatever field holds focus, addressing no element
    "key",  # a key event (Android's system back), no coordinate at all
    "history",  # browser history navigation

# Why the element actuated is not the one the driver's default rule would have named. Absent on the
# ordinary path. This is a separate axis from `via`, which answers how the gesture reached its target:
# a substituted tap still travels by `handle`; what changed is *which* element. Like `GESTURES`, an
# unlisted value is opaque text to a reader rather than an error, so an older report stays loadable.

    # was reachable — a container inflated over the control it wraps (BE-XXXX).

# (and a WebView's own space) CSS pixels — so a coordinate is only comparable alongside its space.
