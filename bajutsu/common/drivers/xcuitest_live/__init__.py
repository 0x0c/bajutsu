"""The live-route XCUITest transport — W3C WebDriver against a reserved iOS device (BE-0238).

The local XCUITest path (`drivers/xcuitest.py`) drives a resident BajutsuKit runner over a bespoke
loopback HTTP channel. A device cloud exposes no such runner — only a W3C WebDriver endpoint
(Appium's XCUITest driver) for a device it has reserved. So the *live* route speaks W3C WebDriver to
that endpoint directly from Python, rather than tunnelling the runner channel to a port the grid does
not serve.

Two pieces live here, both faked at the network boundary so no grid is needed on the gate:

- `WebDriverClient` — a minimal in-house W3C client built on `http.client` and injected the same way
  `XcuitestDriver` injects its transport, so the wire mapping is exercised against a fake. It keeps
  the gate free of a third-party WebDriver dependency and matches the runner channel's own stdlib
  client.
- `XcuitestLiveDriver` — the driver, which reuses the shape of `XcuitestDriver`: query the whole
  screen with one broad locator, build the `base.Element` list, resolve the selector Python-side with
  `resolve_unique` (so an ambiguous selector fails immediately — determinism first, prime directive 2)
  and act on the chosen element by the WebDriver element id the query returned. The element id stands
  in for the runner's opaque handle in the same query-resolve-act-by-handle flow.

Slice A landed session lifecycle, `query` / `tap` / `screenshot` / readiness. Slice B wires input and
gestures onto Appium's XCUITest `mobile:` commands (over `POST /execute/sync`), the driver's native
counterparts of the local runner's semantic endpoints: a coordinate tap, double tap, touch-and-hold,
drag, pinch, and rotate, plus text entry through W3C send-keys to the active element. `selectAll` and
`copy` have no first-class Appium XCUITest command — the local runner does them natively — so they
fail loudly on the live route rather than silently no-op'ing (determinism first). The run-time
capability narrowing, config, and docs (Slice C) are the remaining follow-on.
