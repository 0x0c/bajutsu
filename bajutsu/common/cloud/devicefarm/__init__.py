"""AWS Device Farm batch submitter core (BE-0235; iOS support BE-0238; serve fan-out BE-0336).

Device Farm is a *batch* device cloud: it does not lend a device to drive over the network — it runs
*your* commands on a host that already has the reserved device connected (over `adb` on Android, over
the Xcode toolchain on iOS). So this is not a runtime provider (there is no device to acquire); it is
glue that ferries Bajutsu to the Device Farm host and back. Bajutsu runs *inside* Device Farm exactly
as it does anywhere — the same deterministic core, the same pass/fail from machine-checkable
assertions — so the verdict this module surfaces comes from **Bajutsu's own manifest**, never from
Device Farm's run classification.

This module is the reusable core, so the serve fan-out (BE-0336) and the CLI wrapper
(`scripts/devicefarm_submit.py`) share one submitter and one verdict path. The flow, all outside the
deterministic `run`/CI verdict path:

1. `render_test_spec` — the custom-environment test spec that installs deps, runs `bajutsu run`
   (the adb backend on Android, the XCUITest backend on iOS) for each scenario, and copies `runs/`
   into ``$DEVICEFARM_LOG_DIR`` so the artifacts come back.
2. `build_package` — bundle the Bajutsu payload (source/wheel + config + scenarios) for upload.
3. `submit_and_collect` — upload the app artifact (an Android `.apk` or an iOS `.ipa`), the test
   package, and the spec; schedule the run; poll it to completion; download the artifacts; and derive
   the verdict via `verdict_from_manifest`.

The AWS SDK (boto3) is reached only through the `DeviceFarmClient` / `Transfer` seams, so this module
imports without the ``aws`` extra and its logic is unit-tested against an in-memory fake; the real
boto3 client and the presigned-URL transfer that fill those seams live in the CLI wrapper
(`scripts/devicefarm_submit.py`) and serve's startup bootstrap (`bajutsu/serve/batch_bootstrap.py`).
Raw-adb access on the Device Farm host is a by-product of its toolchain rather than a first-class
guarantee (the first-class path is Appium); this module documents that so a future Device Farm change
does not silently break it.
