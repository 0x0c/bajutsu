    // Pinned with `exact:` rather than `from:`: the generator runs as a build-time plugin behind
    // `-skipPackagePluginValidation`, and the runner's .xcodeproj is regenerated and git-ignored, so
    // it carries no resolution of its own — the manifest is the only thing that pins that path.

    // Hummingbird is *not* here yet, though Unit 2 chose it. Unit 4 serves the generated handlers
    // over the runner's existing socket layer, so nothing imports Hummingbird until Unit 5 swaps the
    // listener; declaring it before then would link SwiftNIO into the wheel-bundled runner for code
    // nothing calls, and force the package's iOS floor to 17 for the same nothing.

        // Declared even though the OpenAPI runtime already brings it in: `LegacyBackedTransport`
        // spells the `ServerTransport` signature itself, so the runner's own code imports HTTPTypes

        // already resolve to.

    // Every target's `path:` is explicit and points back into BajutsuKit/: the manifest lives at
    // the repo root so this package resolves over `.package(url:)` from another repo (SPM's
    // git-based resolution requires Package.swift at the clone's root), but the Swift sources stay
    // put alongside the rest of BajutsuKit's non-Swift tooling (Runner/, README.md) rather than
    // moving to the repo root themselves.
