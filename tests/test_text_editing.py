"""Text-editing steps: select / clear / delete / copy (BE-0265).

Verified through the orchestrator's dispatch (FakeDriver records the driver calls) and the
selection-state contract `copy` relies on — `copy` fails deterministically without a prior
`select`, and every other action invalidates a standing selection.
