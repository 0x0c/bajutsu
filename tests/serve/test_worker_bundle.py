"""Tests for delivering an uploaded bundle to the worker that runs the job.

A hosted control plane binds an uploaded zip (BE-0073) or a composed triple (BE-0268) and keeps the
tree on its own disk. A remote worker shares no filesystem with it, so the run used to start against
an `appPath` binary that existed nowhere on the worker and fail opaquely at install time. The lease
now signs a GET URL per stored object the bundle is made of, and the worker rebuilds the tree and
runs the job from its root. Pure packaging over a fake HTTP fetch: no network, no device.
