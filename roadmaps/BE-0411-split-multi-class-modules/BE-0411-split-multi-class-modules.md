## Introduction

86 files under `bajutsu/` define more than one top-level class in the same module. Together they
hold 459 classes. This item splits each of those 86 files into a package directory. Each class
moves to its own module inside that directory. The package's `__init__.py` re-exports every public
name, so every existing import path keeps resolving unchanged. A matching test file splits the same
way when one exists. The change is a physical reorganization: no class gains, loses, or changes a
responsibility, and no test asserts anything new. The one piece of new prose it does require is a
one-line module docstring per new file, where an existing lint rule demands one (Detailed design,
*Three existing mechanisms*).

## Motivation

Two files show the scale of the problem. `bajutsu/common/scenario/models/actions.py` packs 40
classes into 645 lines. `bajutsu/common/drivers/base.py` packs 23 classes into 1044 lines. Most of
the other 84 files follow the same pattern at a smaller scale. A reader who wants one class cannot
reach it from an editor's file tree. The tree indexes by filename, and the target class shares its
filename with dozens of others. The reader instead opens the file and searches inside it, or greps
for a line number first.

An AI agent editing one class pays that cost a second way. Reaching the target class still means
loading the whole file. An edit to one class carries the unrelated other 39 classes along in
context. A file grows as new classes get added to it, so this cost compounds: the next class added
to `actions.py` makes the file larger for every reader and every edit after it, not merely for the
one adding it.

Splitting to one class per file removes both costs at once. A filename search or a file-tree click
reaches a class directly. An edit to one class loads that class's file alone. A reader can check
that this landed without reading anything else. `LongPress` sits somewhere inside `actions.py`
today. After the split, opening it resolves straight to `actions/long_press.py` from the file
tree. It needs no intermediate search.

## Detailed design

### Split rule

The split replaces each of the 86 files that define two or more top-level classes with a package
directory of the same name. Six rules apply.

1. **One file per class.** `foo.py` becomes `foo/`. The package's `__init__.py` carries the
   original module's docstring, then imports and re-exports every public class in the original
   declaration order, declaring every re-exported name in an `__all__`. The `__all__` is written
   whether or not the original file had one: `F` is in ruff's `select` (`pyproject.toml`) with no
   `__init__.py` per-file-ignore, so an import that exists only to re-export raises `F401` and
   fails `make lint` otherwise. Each class moves to `snake_case(ClassName).py`. A private class
   such as `_Model` moves to `_model.py`, keeping its leading underscore in the filename. The rule
   applies the same way to every kind of `class`: a Pydantic model, a `TypedDict`, a `Protocol`, an
   `Exception`, or a plain `dataclass`.
2. **Top-level functions stay together, in one file.** This item's scope is classes, not
   functions. A file's top-level functions move as a group into `_functions.py` inside the new
   package. They do not scatter into `__init__.py`, and they do not split one function per file.
   62 of the 86 files define at least one top-level function alongside their classes.
   `bajutsu/common/backend_cli/adb.py` alone defines 66. Without this rule, those functions would
   crowd back into `__init__.py` and undo the size reduction for the files carrying the most code.
   `__init__.py` re-exports a public function from `_functions.py` the same way it re-exports a
   class.
3. **Explicit intra-package imports.** A class that subclasses or references another class from the
   same original file now imports it explicitly, with a relative import
   (`from ._model import _Model`). The two classes no longer share a module scope.
4. **Module-level code with no single owner moves to `__init__.py`; code with one owner stays in
   that owner's file.** Code genuinely used by more than one split-off class has nowhere else to
   go. One example is
   [`serve/server/models.py`](https://github.com/bajutsu-e2e/bajutsu/blob/main/bajutsu/serve/server/models.py)'s
   `_JSON`, a SQLAlchemy column-type variant that six different ORM model classes pass to
   `mapped_column`.

   Code tied to exactly one class or function stays in that owner's own file, even at module
   level. Moving it breaks the reference in one case, or, when a moved function rebinds it with
   `global`, stops updating it without an error: `global` cannot reach a name in another module.
   [`assertions.py`](https://github.com/bajutsu-e2e/bajutsu/blob/main/bajutsu/common/scenario/models/assertions.py)'s
   `_ASSERTION_KINDS` is the first shape: `Assertion.model_fields` derives it and
   `Assertion._one_kind` is its sole reader, so it stays with `Assertion`. `drivers/playwright.py`'s
   `_PW_ERRORS` is the second: `_playwright_error_types` rebinds it with `global` to memoize an
   optional import, so the memo stays wherever rule 2 sends that function — `_functions.py`.
5. **A new circular import gets the existing lazy-import treatment.**
   `bajutsu/common/config/schema.py`'s `Config` model already imports `bajutsu.common.config.resolve`
   inside a method body, not at module load, to avoid a cycle. The split resolves any circular
   import it newly introduces the same way.
6. **An entry-point guard moves to `__main__.py`.** `python -m <package>` runs `__main__.py`, never
   `__init__.py`. A guard left in the package body loses its entry point, and nothing raises. `bajutsu/common/provisioning/provision.py` is the one file of the 86 with an
   `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. Both `scripts/install.sh` and the web-e2e workflow invoke it
   that way.

### Implementation: a parsing script, not manual edits

A Python script applies rules 1–3 and 5–6 mechanically, run once per batch against that batch's file
list — not an editor, human or AI, splitting each file by hand. An AI agent reading and rewriting
459 classes one at a time would spend tokens roughly in proportion to that count; a script pays a
fixed authoring cost once and then runs at no further token cost per batch. It parses each target
file with
[`libcst`](https://github.com/Instagram/LibCST) rather than the standard-library `ast`, since `ast`
drops comments, and many classes in these files carry a leading comment explaining a design choice
that the split must not lose. The script extracts each top-level `class` or `def` node together
with its leading comment block and writes it, byte-for-byte, to the file rule 1 or rule 2 names. It
scans each extracted class's body for references to sibling top-level names and emits the relative
import rule 3 needs. It writes `__init__.py` from the same parse: the original module docstring,
one import per class or function, and the `__all__` list. `libcst` becomes a dev-only dependency
for this one script, not a runtime one.

The script does not decide rule 4's two-case split — whether a piece of module-level code has a
single owner or none — since that call needs the same judgment this design applied to
`_ASSERTION_KINDS` and `_PW_ERRORS`. That judgment, and authoring each new module's `D100`
docstring, are the two things each batch still does by hand, working from the rules and examples
above.

The script earns trust the same way any other piece of this codebase does: with its own test
suite (`tests/test_split_modules.py` or similar), covering each rule above against small fixture
modules — a class with a leading comment, a class referencing a sibling, a file with `__all__` and
one without, a function `global`-rebinding a module-level name. That suite passes before the
script runs against a single real file. Running it against real files, batch by batch, is what
the batch entries in *Progress* below track.

### Test-side split

Take a test file with a matching source file — for example `tests/scenario/test_models_actions.py`
for `bajutsu/common/scenario/models/actions.py`. It splits into one test module per class, the same
way the source does. The resulting test directory gets an empty `__init__.py`. `pyproject.toml`'s
`[tool.pytest.ini_options]` sets no `--import-mode`, so pytest's default `prepend` mode needs every
test module's filename to be unique across the whole suite. The empty `__init__.py` turns the new
directory into a package and heads off that constraint. Eight class names repeat across the 85
files. `DeviceError` and `Env` both name a class in `bajutsu/common/backend_cli/adb.py` and in
`bajutsu/common/backend_cli/simctl.py`, for one. Without the package boundary, two of their split
test files would collide on the same `test_device_error.py` name. A source file with no dedicated
unit-test file — covered by an integration test alone — gets no new test file. The scope here is
splitting what exists, not adding coverage that does not.

A test that patches by module path gets re-pointed in the same commit as its source file.
`tests/` calls `monkeypatch.setattr("bajutsu.<module>.<name>", ...)` in about a hundred places.
Patching a name that `__init__.py` merely re-exports rebinds the re-export, not the binding the
caller resolves. That break stays quiet in some cases and raises in others.

`bajutsu.run.notify._RETRY_DELAY` (four call sites, batch 2) is a quiet case. `_deliver` moves to
`_functions.py` with its own binding under rule 2. The patch stops applying, and the retry test
sleeps for real instead of exercising the patched value.
`bajutsu.common.drivers.playwright._PW_ERRORS` and `bajutsu.common.drivers.xcuitest.XcuitestDriver`
(batch 7) fail the same quiet way.

`bajutsu.common.drivers.base.time.sleep` and `.time.monotonic` (ten call sites, batch 7) raise
`AttributeError` instead, once `base/__init__.py` no longer imports `time` itself.

### Five existing mechanisms keyed on today's file paths

`coverage-floors.json` records a per-file coverage floor keyed by path
([BE-0385](../BE-0385-coverage-floor-continuous-ratchet/BE-0385-coverage-floor-continuous-ratchet.md)).
A path the split creates has no floor recorded yet. `scripts/coverage_floors.py` treats that gap as
informational rather than an error, so it stays harmless while the split is in progress. Running
`make coverage-floors` once, after the last batch lands, regenerates the whole snapshot with the
new paths.

The `Makefile`'s `DOCSTRING_PATHS` variable lists the modules `lint-docstrings` checks under the
BE-0065 Google-style docstring migration. 26 of today's 85 multi-class files appear in it by their
exact `.py` path. `bajutsu/common/drivers/base.py` and `bajutsu/analysis/audit.py` are two
examples. Another 15 files are already covered by a directory entry instead of a file entry.
Splitting a file listed by its exact path stops `lint-docstrings` from
checking it. The drop is silent, not loud. `ruff` exits 0 on a path that
is not there. A stale entry stops enforcing docstrings on that surface,
and says nothing. The implementation adds an existence guard to
the `lint-docstrings` recipe. The guard turns that silent drop into a
hard stop. A directory entry needs no change to the entry itself.

A directory entry carries a consequence the file entries do not, though. `lint-docstrings` selects
the whole `D` family minus `D102`/`D105`/`D107`, which leaves `D100` (missing docstring in a public
module) active. It applies to every module the split creates under any of the 41 covered files —
both the 26 renamed from a file entry and the 15 already covered by a directory entry.
`bajutsu/common/scenario` already covers `models/actions.py`, so each of its 40 new per-class
modules needs its own module docstring written, not merely carried over. Across all 41 covered
files, that totals 275 new module docstrings to author. That is real prose, not a mechanical
carry-over, and a cost the Introduction's framing does not fully capture on its own.
`bajutsu/common/scenario` and `bajutsu/common/drivers/` (batches 11 and 7) hold the largest share
of it. `actions.py` and `base.py` are the two files with the most classes to begin with.

[`docs/architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture.md)'s module-list table names 15 of the 85 files
by their exact `.py` path too:

- every file under `bajutsu/common/drivers/`
- `config_source.py`, `doctor.py`, `handoff.py`
- `provisioning/provision.py`, `provisioning/requirements.py`
- `run/notify.py`

`scripts/lint_module_map.py` runs as `make lint-module-map`, part of `make check`. It fails when a
table entry names a path absent from the tree, so splitting one of these files without renaming
its table entry breaks the gate. The same check also descends one level into `bajutsu/common/`,
looking for an undocumented subpackage. `config_source.py`, `doctor.py`, and `handoff.py` sit
directly under `common/`. Splitting one of them turns its new package directory into an
undocumented subpackage, unless the table entry moves to the new directory path in the same
commit. Renaming the entry's path cell satisfies both checks at once.

[`scripts/e2e_changes.py`](https://github.com/bajutsu-e2e/bajutsu/blob/main/scripts/e2e_changes.py)
decides which on-device CI lanes a change triggers. It names about thirty
modules by their exact `.py` path. The names appear in three places: the
per-lane patterns, the shared run filter, and the periphery exclusions.
Splitting one without updating its entry reproduces what the script's own
comment records from
[BE-0252](../BE-0252-config-package-split/BE-0252-config-package-split.md).
Every file under the new package stops matching. The lane's `changes` job
then reports nothing relevant. The required aggregator goes green without
running a thing. The script's own tests catch a stale plain path. They do
not catch a stale regular expression, so each batch checks both.

`pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.importlinter]` contracts name `bajutsu.common.drivers.base` as a
`source_modules` or `forbidden_modules` entry in three contracts. Two more modules this split
touches join it there: `bajutsu.common.drivers.actuation` and `bajutsu.common.doctor`. These
contracts guard the deterministic core's independence from the periphery.

Those entries need no change. import-linter resolves a named module to itself plus every
descendant, so a plain module turning into a package stays covered — the same subtree semantics
the artifact-sink contract's own comment in `pyproject.toml` already relies on.

One entry names an exact edge rather than a subtree, and that one does break. The contract that
keeps the scenario schema and `Driver` Protocol a portable inner layer has an `ignore_imports`
entry covering a single edge: `bajutsu.common.drivers.base -> bajutsu.common.evidence.network`.
That edge is a `TYPE_CHECKING`-guarded reference to `Collector`, made for
the `network_collector` signature. The signature belongs to
`EvidenceProvider`, not to `Driver`. Batch 7 gives that Protocol its own
file, so the real edge becomes
`bajutsu.common.drivers.base.evidence_provider -> bajutsu.common.evidence.network`.
The recorded string no longer matches it. `unmatched_ignore_imports_alerting`
defaults to `error`, so `make lint-imports` fails on the stale entry. Batch 7's commit updates it
to the new module path.

### Work breakdown

The 86 files group into 14 batches along their existing directory boundaries. Each batch is one
commit on a single PR.

Each batch's commit updates the `DOCSTRING_PATHS` entries and the `docs/architecture.md` table rows
for the files it touches, wherever that batch contains a file listed there by its `.py` path, and
writes the module docstring `D100` requires into every new module under a `DOCSTRING_PATHS`-covered
file. Batch 7's commit also updates the `ignore_imports` entry in `pyproject.toml`.
`make coverage-floors` and the final `make check` each run once, after every batch lands.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Why not |
|---|---|
| Split each directory batch into its own small PR, following this repo's usual "one topic, one branch" preference | A single long-lived PR touching nearly every package is real friction. It competes for a rebase against any other branch editing the same files. `git`'s rename detection does not track a plain file becoming many, either. Splitting into 14 PRs does not remove this friction: a concurrent PR editing `bajutsu/common/drivers/` still conflicts with batch 7's commit, whether that commit sits in this PR or its own. 14 PRs would only add 14 review-and-merge round trips for files with no dependency on each other. One PR with per-batch commits keeps a single round trip, still lets a reviewer read one directory's diff at a time, and stays open only as long as the batches take to land. |
| Exclude the files where several classes are deliberately grouped as one concept's variants — `actions.py`, `assertions.py`, `bajutsu/common/config/schema.py`. A comment in `assertions.py` (line 309) says a new variant belongs in one place. | These are the files the Motivation section names as the worst case: 40 classes and 645 lines for `actions.py` alone. Excluding them would leave the file-tree and context-loading cost this item exists to remove standing in the files where it bites hardest. |
| Group related classes into a few files per module, instead of one file per class | This does not reach the goal a filename search or a file-tree click depends on: a class still shares a filename with its group. It also swaps one clear rule — one class, one file — for a second judgment call: how to draw each group's boundary. The saving is modest too, since the 446-class total shrinks only a little when a group still holds two or three classes each. |
| Split each file by hand — a human or an AI agent, editing one file at a time | 459 classes across 86 files is 459 chances to drop a leading comment, mis-copy a class body, or forget an intra-package import. A script applies rules 1–3 and 5–6 the same way every time and cannot introduce that class of error; the batches still need human judgment for rule 4's ownership calls and for authoring `D100` docstrings, but that judgment shrinks to a handful of cases per batch instead of 459. An AI agent editing 459 classes one at a time also spends tokens roughly in proportion to that count, where a script pays a fixed authoring cost once. |

Log:

- PR_LOG_PLACEHOLDER — every batch, in one pass.
  `scripts/split_modules.py` and its suite land first. The 14 batches then
  follow in order. No module under `bajutsu/` now defines more than one
  top-level class. The whole existing test suite passes unaltered
  throughout. That is what shows the reorganization carries no behavior
  with it.

  Running the script against real code found eight defects in it. Each one got a regression test
  before the batch it blocked. Three rounds of self-review over the finished diff found eleven
  more, listed after these.

  - Tuple-unpacking assignment targets were invisible, so nothing imported the names they bind.
  - Python Enhancement Proposal 695 (PEP 695) type-parameter bounds went unread.
  - A quoted forward reference written outside an annotation went unread too.
  - A class-body field sharing a sibling's name read as a reference to that sibling.
  - A name an inner `import` binds counted as a read.
  - Module-level code derived from its own owner came out above that owner.
  - Reads merged per declaration, not per target file. A module's last function
    was then the sole one counted as an owner.

  Two rules changed shape under real code. Deferring an annotation-only
  sibling under `TYPE_CHECKING` breaks Pydantic. Pydantic resolves
  annotations at run time. A sibling import is now a runtime import by
  default, and a cycle is what defers it. Rule 4's no-single-owner case
  splits in two. Code that binds nothing runs at the end of
  `__init__.py`, where this item's design puts it. Code that binds a name
  goes to a `_shared.py` instead, because `__init__.py` re-exports the
  modules that read that name back.

  Rule 4 also counts a module-level statement as an owner of another.
  `oplog.py`'s `_CONTEXT_KEYS` and the context variables beside it had
  landed in two files that then imported each other at module load.
  Fifteen new cycles took rule 5's in-method import by hand, each on its
  single edge.

  Forty-two `monkeypatch` targets across the suite now name the module that owns the binding. Most
  were the quiet kind this item's design predicts. A retry test would have slept for real. A
  cache-hit test asserting a call is *not* made would have passed vacuously. So would every
  rejection test that lowers an upload cap. One cost more than correctness. A
  cold-startup ceiling the patch no longer reached left
  `test_spawn_cold_discards_a_never_ready_runner` waiting out its real 120
  seconds on every run of the gate. It now takes a quarter of a second.

  Three rounds of self-review found eleven further defects of one kind. The script
  produced a wrong-but-plausible package and reported success.

  - It wrote an unbreakable cycle to disk under a note.
  - It read a `Literal["Beta"]` string as a forward reference.
  - It brought a sibling back as a module-level import that a method already
    imported for itself. That restored a cycle rule 5 had broken by hand.
  - It re-exported a `global`-rebound name by value. The package attribute then
    froze at import while the real binding moved on, which is what had made one
    usage-ledger assertion unconditionally true.
  - It pruned a method's local import file-wide. The module-level statement beside
    it then lost the header import it still read.
  - It read every subscript as annotation context. A runtime read inside one was
    then free to move under `TYPE_CHECKING`, where the name resolves to nothing.

  Each of the eleven is a refusal or a fix now. The tidy-up step, the delete step,
  and the batch loop each report a fault rather than an exit code of zero. The
  suite grew from 41 tests to 94, at 92 percent branch coverage of the script. It
  now writes three representative plans into real packages, imports them, and
  lints them. That is the script's actual contract, which every other assertion
  had stood in for.

  `make check` is green, and total coverage measures 94.71 percent across
  the suite. The test-side split is the one part of the design left
  undone. These test files group their cases by function, not by source class.
  Rule 2 already keeps a module's functions together.
  Splitting them per class would re-partition the suite rather than
  mirror the source.
